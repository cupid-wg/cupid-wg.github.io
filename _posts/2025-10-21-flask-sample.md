I create project [flask sample](https://github.com/cupid-wg/flask-sample) project to show how to use flask to create a restful api.In the project, i use sqlalchemy as ORM to interact with database, alembic to manage database migration, pydantic to validate request and build response, and flasgger to generate swagger documentation.

And use gunicorn to run the flask app, so it support parallel requests.

Welcome to try the sample and very appreciate the comments.
